# Design Overview

## Building a Platform Engineering Playground

This homelab exists as a **continuously-running, production-grade playground** for platform engineering experimentation, learning, and demonstration. Unlike cloud environments with per-hour costs or development laptops that get shut down, this infrastructure provides:

- **Always-on availability** for testing and iteration
- **Minimal operational cost** through energy efficiency
- **Real production patterns** without cloud vendor lock-in
- **Complete control** over the entire stack from hardware to applications

## The Problem Statement

As a Principal DevOps Engineer, staying current with platform engineering practices requires hands-on experience with:

- Kubernetes cluster operations at scale
- GitOps workflows and deployment automation
- Security hardening and compliance patterns
- Infrastructure-as-code best practices
- Custom operator development
- Multi-environment orchestration

**Cloud environments** are expensive for 24/7 operation and create vendor lock-in. **Local development** lacks the distributed nature of real clusters. **Work environments** are limited to specific tooling and can't be freely experimented with.

## The Solution: Energy-Efficient Homelab

This homelab bridges the gap by providing:

### 1. Real Distributed Infrastructure
- 5-node Kubernetes cluster with multi-master HA
- True distributed etcd for state management
- Real load balancing and ingress patterns
- Actual network segmentation and policies

### 2. Minimal Operating Cost
- **Total power draw**: 28-40W (less than a laptop)
- **Monthly electricity**: ~$3-5 at typical rates
- **Initial cost**: ~$1000-1500 (one-time)
- **Cloud equivalent**: $200-400/month for similar capabilities

### 3. Complete Flexibility
- Full control from BIOS to application layer
- Experiment with breaking changes without fear
- Learn from failures in a safe environment
- Showcase expertise through real implementations

## What Makes This Special

### Production-Grade Patterns
This isn't a hobby project—it implements enterprise patterns:
- Pod Security Admissions (PSA) with restricted policies
- OIDC authentication with Google Workspace
- Comprehensive audit logging and metrics
- Secret encryption and deterministic management
- Network policies and segmentation
- Automated certificate lifecycle management

### GitOps-First Architecture
Everything flows through Git:
- Infrastructure defined in Helmfiles
- Applications deployed via ArgoCD
- Automated synchronization between GitHub and Gitea
- CI/CD pipelines triggering on Git events
- Declarative configuration with audit trails

### Custom Automation
Beyond off-the-shelf tools, this includes:
- **DerivedSecret Operator**: Deterministic secret generation from master password using Argon2id
- **PartialIngress Operator**: Partial environment deployments with automatic service replication
- **Metabase CNPG Operator**: Automatic database discovery and connection management
- **Gitea Automation**: GitHub organization synchronization and token management
- **Restrictive HTTP Proxy**: Path-based security boundaries for internal services

## Target Audience

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

### For Other Engineers
Demonstrate technical depth in:
- Kubernetes cluster architecture and operations
- Security hardening and compliance
- Infrastructure-as-code best practices
- Custom operator development
- GitOps workflow design

### For Learning
Provide reference implementations for:
- Bare metal Kubernetes on ARM64
- Cilium CNI with eBPF networking
- Deterministic secret management
- Multi-environment DNS and ingress
- Self-hosted Git and CI/CD

### For Collaboration
Enable others to:
- Understand the architecture through clear documentation
- Replicate components for their own use
- Contribute via VPN access (planned)
- Learn from real production patterns

## Cost Analysis

> "Initial cost matters less than operational efficiency for long-term sustainability."

### Capital Expenditure (One-Time)
- **Compute**: 5x Raspberry Pi CM5 blades with NVMe
- **Networking**: MikroTik router + PoE switches
- **Total**: ~$1000-1500

This is comparable to a single month of medium-sized cloud infrastructure but provides unlimited experimental time.

### Operational Expenditure (Monthly)
- **Power**: 40W × 24h × 30 days = 28.8 kWh/month
- **Cost**: ~$3-5/month (at $0.12-0.18/kWh)
- **Internet**: Existing home connection (no additional cost)

### Value Proposition
- **Learning value**: Hands-on experience with production patterns
- **Career development**: Demonstrable expertise in platform engineering
- **Reusability**: Infrastructure code applicable to real projects
- **Flexibility**: Experiment without cloud bills
